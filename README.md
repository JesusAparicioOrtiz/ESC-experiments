# ESC-experiments
Experiments made with [Elastic-Smart-Contracts](https://github.com/isa-group/elastic-smart-contracts)

All experiments are divided in folders with an ID. Inside each experiment folder, there are a couple of things:
- A folder for each ESC started during the experiment.
- (Only in recent experiments) "Curva_Regresion" CSV file, which gives some information about analysis executions for every ESC of the experiment in time intervals.
- (Only in recent experiments) "Info" CSV file, which gives the total time of execution, analysis execution time and window for every analysis in each ESC.
